PubExchange Licensing Terms

Licensing Agreement

PubExchange offers publishers the ability to use our tools and services ad-free by paying a monthly licensing fee. By choosing to pay the licensing fee, you will not be required to promote your partners' paid content through your social media accounts and depending on the option selected in your user account settings page, no paid content will be shown in your PubExchange modules.

Billing

Payment can be made through credit cards or invoiced payments. If you elect to pay via credit card, PubExchange will automatically charge your credit card monthly. If PubExchange is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, PubExchange reserves the right to suspend or revoke access to your account. If you elect to receive invoices, PubExchange shall invoice you on or about the first day of each calendar month for fees and expenses incurred during the upcoming month and you agree to pay each invoice within thirty (30) days after receipt.

If you have opted to pay the licensing fee, but no longer qualify for your licensing fee level, you will be notified by a PubExchange representative and given a 30-day grace period to either pay for the more expense licensing fee, or revert your account back to the free, ad-supported account.

PubExchange may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email. If you want to use a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your information by accessing your account page. If your credit card reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the PubExchange constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that credit card and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information and payment information current and updated.

Ending Licensing Agreement

Your ad-free license will continue in effect unless and until you opt to no longer pay for a licensing fee and choose to use our ad-supported tools and services or we terminate it. You must cancel the licensing fee before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month's fees to your credit card. PubExchange will bill the monthly fees associated with your licensing fee plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your account information).

PubExchange licensing fees are prepaid and are non-refundable. PUBEXCHANGE DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL MONTHS. You may opt out of your ad-free license at anytime, and cancellation will be effective immediately. If you wish to opt out of your ad-free license you may do so via your account page. Should you elect to opt out of your ad-free license, please note that you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged monthly fees.

By opting for an ad-free license to PubExchange and providing PubExchange with your payment account information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.
